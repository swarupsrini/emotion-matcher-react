# Emotion matcher
A team project of 4 people created in ReactJS for Hack the North 2019, this is a web application designed to help people connect with emotionally compatible users. The application uses the Azure API to analyze a photo of your face to determine your emotion and uses an algorithm to match you with other emotionally compatible users.

# Usage
Just visit [https://swarupsrini.github.io/emotion-matcher-react/](https://swarupsrini.github.io/emotion-matcher-react/) to use the application!

To use the emotion matching functionality, open the website on two different systems, login/signup on each of the systems and click the `+emote` to record user emotions on both systems. If the emotions match up, the two users can click `+chat` to open up a chat channel between them. A quick refresh of the page allows both users to communicate with their newfound emotionally matched partner.
